# Public Assets Folder

Place your static files here:

1. **resume.pdf** - Your resume/CV file
2. **favicon.ico** - Your website icon
3. Any other static assets

## How to add your resume:

1. Copy your resume PDF file to this folder
2. Rename it to `resume.pdf`
3. The download buttons in your portfolio will automatically work

Files in this folder are served at the root URL.
For example: `public/resume.pdf` becomes accessible at `/resume.pdf`
